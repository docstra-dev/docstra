# Media Chat Module
=====================

## Overview
-----------

The media chat module is a VSCode extension that enables real-time communication between users through a web-based interface. It provides a simple and intuitive way to share files, messages, and other media with colleagues or friends.

## Implementation Details
------------------------

The module uses WebSockets to establish a bi-directional communication channel between the client and server. The client-side application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while the server-side application is written in Node.js.

### Server-Side Application

The server-side application is responsible for managing the WebSocket connections, handling incoming messages, and storing user data. It uses a MongoDB database to store user information and chat history.

### Client-Side Application

The client-side application is responsible for rendering the UI, handling user input, and establishing WebSocket connections with the server.

## Usage Examples
-----------------

To use the media chat module, follow these steps:

1. Install the extension in VSCode.
2. Launch the extension by clicking on the "Media Chat" icon in the VSCode toolbar.
3. Enter a username and password to log in to the application.
4. Click on the "Start Chat" button to initiate a new conversation.
5. Type a message or share a file with others.

## Classes
---------

### `ChatClient`

Represents a client-side WebSocket connection.

#### Attributes

*   `id`: Unique identifier for the client.
*   `username`: The username associated with the client.
*   `socket`: The WebSocket object used to establish communication with the server.

#### Methods

*   `connect()`: Establishes a new WebSocket connection with the server.
*   `disconnect()`: Closes the current WebSocket connection.
*   `send(message)`: Sends a message to the server via the WebSocket connection.
*   `receive()`: Receives incoming messages from the server via the WebSocket connection.

### `ChatServer`

Represents a server-side WebSocket connection.

#### Attributes

*   `id`: Unique identifier for the server.
*   `username`: The username associated with the server.
*   `socket`: The WebSocket object used to establish communication with clients.

#### Methods

*   `connect()`: Establishes a new WebSocket connection with a client.
*   `disconnect()`: Closes the current WebSocket connection.
*   `handleMessage(message)`: Handles incoming messages from clients via the WebSocket connection.
*   `storeUser(data)`: Stores user data in the MongoDB database.

## Functions
------------

### `initChatClient(username, password)`

Initializes a new client-side WebSocket connection with the given username and password.

#### Parameters

*   `username`: The username to use for the client.
*   `password`: The password to use for the client.

#### Return Value

The initialized `ChatClient` object.

### `handleIncomingMessage(message, socket)`

Handles incoming messages from clients via the WebSocket connection.

#### Parameters

*   `message`: The incoming message from the client.
*   `socket`: The WebSocket object used to establish communication with the client.

## Important Dependencies
-------------------------

The media chat module depends on the following libraries and frameworks:

*   Node.js: Used for server-side application development.
*   MongoDB: Used as a database to store user data and chat history.
*   WebSockets: Used for bi-directional communication between clients and servers.

## Notes
------

*   The module uses a simple authentication mechanism based on username and password. In a production environment, consider using more secure authentication methods.
*   The module stores user data in the MongoDB database. Consider implementing data encryption and access controls to protect sensitive information.
*   The module uses a basic chat interface with text input and file sharing capabilities. Consider adding more features, such as video conferencing or voice messaging, to enhance the user experience.
